# Capstone-Project-Import
Final project!
This was my final project for my AAS in Computer Science.  It is a Point of Sale to sell custom guitars by serial number.  It is developed
using C#, ADO.NET, and connected to SQL (SSMS).  There are employee, customer, order, and stock pages.  Each has the ability to create new
objects for the database via the midtier using stored procedures. The customer can see a receipt on the screen as well as receive a email 
automatically sent when the order button is clicked.  The address is pulled from the database and then a onclick function sends the email. 
The database is normalized, has primary and foreign keys, and stored procedures.  It was a lot of fun to make!
